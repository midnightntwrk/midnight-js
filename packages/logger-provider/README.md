# What is this?
This enables DApp developers to provide an implementation specific [pino](https://getpino.io/#/) logger Midnight.js will use for reporting low level diagnostics. The provided logger must not use custom levels. If no logger is provided, Midnight.js will run silently.

Log messages will be done as follows:
- `debug`: External calls to APIs.
- `trace`: Internal diagnostics.


This package was created for the [Midnight network](https://midnight.network).
